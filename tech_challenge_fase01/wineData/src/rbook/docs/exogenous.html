<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Nas seções <strong>?@sec-tsexplore</strong> e <strong>?@sec-tsexploretop</strong>, analisamos as séries temporais de modo isolado, ou seja, sem considerar a eventual interação com outros eventos e, portanto, podemos dizer que foi realizada uma análise univariada.</p>
<p>Para a melhor compreensão do fenômeno de que estamos tratando seria necessário também a realização de uma análise multivariada, por meio da qual é possível entender melhor a interação das séries em estudo com outras séries que eventualmente possam auxiliar.Ocorre que uma análise multivariada está fora do escopo deste trabalho.</p>

<p>Também é importante ressaltar que, conforme exposto na <strong>?@sec-tsexplore</strong>, as séries possuem raízes unitárias e, portanto, qualquer inferência realizada por meio de medidas de correlação entre as séries deve ser vista com extrema cautela, uma vez que podem ser simplesmente correlações espúrias.</p>

<p>A <a href="#tbl-data_climate" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> apresenta os dados médios mensais de precipitação, temperatura e vento, extraídos da página do INMET. Os dados são oriundos da estação de Bento Gonçalves, entre novembro de 2006 e dezembro de 2022. Os dados tiveram que passar por um tratamento, visto que havia uma quantidade significative de NAs: 18 na coluna de precipitação, 7 na coluna de temperatura e 8 na de velocidade do vento. Foi adotada então uma estratégia de aproximação por meio de interpolação linear e eliminação da primeira observação, uma vez que esta não pôde ser ajustada desta forma.</p>

<p>As <a href="#fig-data_climate-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> a <a href="#fig-data_climate_anom-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a> mostram que não foram detectadas anomalias nas séries de precipitação, temperatura e vento. Inclusive os dados médios encontrados favorecem a produção de uva e, consequentemente de vinho. Além disso, tendo por base a literatura consultada, dos três fatores climáticos elencados, a temperatura e a precipitação são os mais relevantes.</p>

<p>Mais uma vez é importante sublinhar que para séries temporais a simples correlação não é um teste recomendado para testar a contribuição de uma série para o comportamento da outra, especialmente se as séries não forem estacionárias. Neste sentido, um teste relativamente simples de causalidade é o teste Granger, que por ser colocado da seguinte forma:</p>
<p><strong>Hipótese Nula (H0):</strong></p>
<p>A série temporal X <em>não causa</em> a série temporal Y no sentido Granger.</p>
<p><strong>Hipótese Alternativa (H1)</strong>:</p>
<p>A série temporal X <em>causa</em> a série temporal Y no sentido Granger.</p>
<p>Em resumo, o teste permite verificar se saber o valor da série X em determinado <em>lag</em> é últil para realizar previsões osbre o comportamento da série Y em períodos subsequentes - esta é a <em>causalidade no sentido Granger</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>O primeiro passo é verificar se as séries são estacionárias, uma vez que o teste tem como uma de suas premissas a não existência de raízes unitárias.</p>
<p>Aplicando os testes ADF e KPSS, verificamos que existem evidências de não-estacionariedade em ambas as séries.</p>

<p>Então, para realizar o teste de causalidade do tipo Granger, é necessário tornar as séries estacionárias, o que será feito por meio da primeira diferença.</p>
<p>O teste de causalidade Granger é aplicado considerando 2 lags, em face da hipótese de que, em até 2 meses, determinado evento climático deverá ter impacto na variação da produção de uva, aqui traduzida em termos de valor e volume exportados.</p>
<p>Teste Granger para a série de valor exportado - precipitação granger-causa valor exportado indica que não há causalidade (p-valor &gt; 0,05); - temperatura granger-causa valor exportado indica há causalidade (p-valor &lt; 0,05).</p>

<p>Interessante notarmos que, enquanto não encontramos evidências de que a precipitação afeta as nossas variáveis de interesse, encontramos evidência de que a temperatura pode afetar. Isto vai ao encontro do exposto na literatura consultada, uma vez que as variedades de uva cultivadas para a produção de vinho são bastante sensíveis às variações de temperatura.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Dada a natureza do fenômeno analisado, qual seja, exportação de vinhos, vários podem ser os fatores socioeconômicos que afetam o comportamento da série.</p>
<p>Como uma análise extensiva dos fatores está fora do escopo deste trabalho, vamos escolher somente as seguintes séries mensais para ilustrar a análise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taxa Real de Câmbio<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> (número índice): a taxa nominal de câmbio é um indicador freqüentemente consultado pelos agentes econômicos em suas decisões, mas, de fato, estas estão condicionadas à evolução da taxa real de câmbio. Esta taxa busca comparar os custos de produção ou o poder de compra dos consumidores considerando os mercados nacional e internacional, bem como simplesmente confrontar os incentivos à produção de bens comercializáveis e não comercializáveis na economia doméstica. É um número índice para tornar a comparação com a série de valor adequada;</p></li>
<li><p>Indice de Commodities<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (número índice): em que pese o vinho não ser considerado uma commodity, sendo o Brasil grande exportador de commodities, é interessante avaliar se a trajetória de exportação de vinho acompanhou o movimento da maior parte da exportação nacional. O indicador é um número índice para tornar a comparação com a série de valor adequada;</p></li>
<li><p>Índice de Termos de Troca<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> (número índice): Os termos de troca são definidos como a relação entre os preços das exportações do país (<span class="math inline">\(P_x\)</span>) e os das suas importações (<span class="math inline">\(P_m\)</span>). Uma melhoria nos termos de troca – isto é, um aumento na razão <span class="math inline">\(P_x/P_m\)</span> –, tudo o mais constante, aumenta a renda real.Permite, por exemplo, que, com as mesmas exportações, se possa importar mais.</p></li>

<p>Conforme podemos verificar nas <a href="#fig-data_macro_anom-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10</a> a <a href="#fig-data_macro_anom-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12</a>, foram detectadas poucas anomalias nas séries temporais em questão. Porém, chama a atenção o comportamento da série de Índice de Commodities (<strong>?@fig-data_macro_anom2</strong>), em que o período da pandemia de COVID-19 fica bem demarcado. Ao mesmo tempo, no Índice dos Termos de Troca foram identificadas anomalias no perído da crise de 2008.</p>

<p>Então, para realizar o teste de causalidade do tipo Granger, é necessário tornar as séries estacionárias, o que será feito por meio da primeira diferença.</p>
<p>O teste de causalidade Granger é aplicado considerando 12 lags, em face da hipótese de que, em até 12 meses, variações nas séries selecionadas deverão ter impacto no valor e volume exportados.</p>
<p>Teste Granger para a série de valor exportado indica que não há causalidade no sentido Granger para qualquer das séries(p-valor &gt; 0,05).</p>

<p>Para entender como os vinhos brasileiros são recebidos pelo mercado consumidor internacional, buscamos dados de avaliação de vinhos. Neste caso utilizamos como referência o artigo <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/7/1/20">“X-Wines: A Wine Dataset for Recommender Systems and Machine Learning”</a> o qual remete a uma extensa <a href="https://github.com/rogerioxavier/X-Wines/?tab=readme-ov-file">base de dados de avaliação de vinhos</a>.</p>
<p>Para este trabalho utilizamos as bases <em>XWines_Slim_1k_wines</em> e <em>XWines_Slim_150k_ratings</em> as quais contém 150 mil dados de avaliações de usuários sobre 1000 vinhos distintos.</p>
<p>Quando agregamos as notas por país e calculamos a média, verificamos que o Brasil ocupa a 20ª posíção no <em>ranking</em> (abaixo da média da amostra <a href="#fig-boxplot-wines-ratings" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;19</a>), enquanto que o 1º lugar pertence ao Reino Unido.</p>

<p>Em que pese o Brasil ocupar a 20ª posição no <em>ranking</em> de avaliação média dos vinhos, vemos pelo gráfico da <a href="#fig-rating-by-year" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;20</a> que a avaliação dos vinhos brasileiros vem crescendo de modo persistente desde 2012. Isto pode ajudar a explicar a tendência de crescimento no volume e valor das exportações de vinho nos últimos anos.</p>
